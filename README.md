# SnowBreakLauncher-Dotnet
 A custom launcher for [SnowBreak: Containment Zone](https://snowbreak.amazingseasun.com/), written in C# of .NET8.
 
# Notes
 Currently, this is a WIP: The launcher can check for game's update (but not updating it) and start game.

# Dependencies
- [CsWin32](https://github.com/Microsoft/CsWin32): A source code generator which generates P/Invoke function "easily" (as sometimes you have to deal with pointers and aliased types).
- [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia): A cross-platform UI framework.
- [MessageBox.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/MessageBox.Avalonia): MessageBox for [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).
